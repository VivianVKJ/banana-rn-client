The Banana App may monitor any and all use of the Sites, including, without limitation, interactions between our users; however, we are under no obligation to do so.

V. Ratings and Reviews

The Sites and other Interactive Areas may allow you to rate (“Ratings”) and post reviews (“Reviews”) of restaurants and other businesses. Such Ratings and Reviews are considered User Content and are governed by the terms and conditions of this Agreement, including, without limitation, your agreement regarding your use of Interactive Areas and the Sites' standards of conduct. Ratings and Reviews are not endorsed by The Banana App, and do not represent the views of The Banana App or of any affiliate or partner of The Banana App. The Banana App does not assume liability for Ratings and Reviews or for any claims, liabilities, or losses resulting from any Ratings and Reviews. We strive to maintain a high level of integrity with our Ratings and Reviews and other User Content.

COMMUNICATIONS & TEXT MESSAGES
By voluntarily providing your cell phone number to The Banana App, you agree that The Banana App may contact you by telephone, SMS, or MMS messages at that phone number, and you hereby consent to receiving such communications for transactional, operational, or informational purposes. You understand that such messages may be sent using an automatic telephone dialing system. You may unsubscribe from receiving text messages from The Banana App at any time. To revoke your consent to receiving SMS or MMS messages from The Banana App, please follow the unsubscribe procedures described below.

Diners placing orders through the Sites may receive two or more order status messages from The Banana App about each order. To unsubscribe from order-related messages, just reply "STOP" to the number sending the message. To resubscribe, text “START” to the same number from the phone number associated with your account. If you need assistance, text “HELP”. Please note that unsubscribing from one Site will not automatically unsubscribe you from another Site. For example, if you unsubscribe from The Banana App order-related messages, you may still receive order-related messages when you place an order through Seamless, unless you also unsubscribe from Seamless order-related messages.

Additionally, diners may receive messages from The Banana App following receipt of a completed order soliciting feedback and/or other information relating to the order. You may unsubscribe from all such feedback messages by replying "STOP" to the number sending the feedback messages. To resubscribe, text "START" to the number sending the feedback messages using the phone number associated with your account. Please note that unsubscribing from such feedback texts will not prevent you from receiving texts from The Banana App, the restaurant, or your delivery person regarding your order or its delivery unless you also text "STOP" to the number sending the order-related messages, and even in such event, you may still receive individual texts from the restaurant or your delivery person to enable successful delivery of your order.

You may also receive text messages in response to certain Customer Care requests. To unsubscribe from Customer Care messages, just reply to the message by texting “STOP” to the number sending the message.

If you unsubscribe from receiving text messages from The Banana App through the process described above, you may continue to receive text messages for a short period while The Banana App processes your request(s). If you change or deactivate the phone number you provided to The Banana App, you have an affirmative obligation to update your account information and the phone number(s) attached to your account to prevent us from inadvertently communicating with anyone who acquires any phone number(s) previously attributed to you, and any new phone number(s) you attach to your account may receive The Banana App’s standard SMS or MMS messages unless you also unsubscribe via the above procedures.

Standard data and message rates may apply for SMS and MMS alerts, whether you send or receive such messages. Please contact your mobile phone carrier for details. Your mobile phone carrier (e.g. T-Mobile, AT&T, Verizon, etc.) is not liable for delayed or undelivered messages. If you require assistance, please call our Customer Care team at 1-877-585-7878.
